## My VSCode Experience

My experience with VSCode has been somewhat neutral. I have used VSCode for a long time, so I am fairly accustomed to it. However, during this course, I had to download many extensions and work with repositories from GitHub. I also learned how to use different extensions, such as ESLint and HTML Boilerplate. Since I am not very familiar with HTML, the HTML Boilerplate extension has been incredibly helpful for quickly implementing code for a website and inspecting it effectively. Additionally, GitHub Copilot has been useful for providing AI-assisted guidance and suggestions. Before this course, I didn’t realize that VSCode has a built-in terminal; I used to only write code and run it through the debug feature. Discovering the integrated terminal has been a game changer for my workflow.

##  My ESLint Experience

My experience with ESLint in VSCode has been somewhat frustrating at times. Whenever I create a new repository for a coding assignment, I often have to download the same files repeatedly. Additionally, on my computer, ESLint is restricted, so I have to use a bypass in the terminal to run npm install. Despite these annoyances, the features that ESLint provides are very helpful. Commands like npm run lint and npm run lint-fix make it easy to identify errors in the code and automatically format it according to the coding standards. However, when these features don’t work, manually fixing the errors can be tedious. We have to individually edit lines to ensure the code adheres to the standards, which can be time-consuming but ultimately reinforces good coding habits.
