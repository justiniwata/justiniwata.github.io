## Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an increasingly visible part of education, especially in fields like Software Engineering, where problem solving, abstraction, and tooling are central skills. In software engineering courses, AI tools can act as tutors, code reviewers, documentation assistants, and brainstorming partners. In ICS 314, which emphasizes professional software engineering practices such as JavaScript programming, testing, UI frameworks, Agile development, and code quality, AI tools are particularly relevant because they overlap directly with real-world developer workflows. In my coursework, I have primarily used AI tools such as ChatGPT and, to a lesser extent, GitHub Copilot. I have experimented with these tools for understanding concepts, generating examples, debugging code, and improving documentation. This essay reflects on how AI influenced my learning experience in ICS 314, where it helped in some situations but was deliberately avoided in others to ensure deeper understanding.
