## Introduction

Communication is really important in becoming a software engineer, so try to communicate with other people. With asking someone like a teacher or an employer so the software engineer can ask questions or ask for help to integrate their code into an application. The article “Eric Raymond’s How to Ask Questions the Smart Way” has long been regarded as a blueprint for interactions within an open-source community. By asking very informative questions, this can help a software engineer get a precise question for the employer to reply to. Rather than asking a less informative question, this can lead to more misinformation for the software engineer and the communicator.
