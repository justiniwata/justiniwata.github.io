## Introduction

Communication is really important in becoming a software engineer, so try to communicate with other people. With asking someone like a teacher or an employer so the software engineer can ask questions or ask for help to integrate their code into an application. The article “Eric Raymond’s How to Ask Questions the Smart Way” has long been regarded as a blueprint for interactions within an open-source community. By asking very informative questions, this can help a software engineer get a precise question for the employer to reply to. Rather than asking a less informative question, this can lead to more misinformation for the software engineer and the communicator. 

## StackOverflow Questions

StackOverflow will provide a good real-world system with the use of Raymond's principles. One example is the use of dividing and producing a rounding error. With a response of a snippet of something from a programming language like Python 3, also provide a small snippet of code with this and describe how the code words and the unexpected outputs. This follows Raymond's advice; with this kind of response, it will show if the person has prior research of the code that they implemented. However, in StackOverflow there are many poor examples of the questions that are often quickly closed; for example, someone's Java loop is not working. What can someone do with a vague description and no context with a poor question?
