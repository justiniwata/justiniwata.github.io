For this project, I assembled a Zoom75 barebones keyboard kit by following the manual and troubleshooting the wiring to ensure full functionality. I also installed a small LCD screen inside the keyboard by replacing one of the original badges. Prior to assembly, I pre-lubricated the switches to improve sound and typing feel. After setup, I customized the LCD screen to display different visuals.
