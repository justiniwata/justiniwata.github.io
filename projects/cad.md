For this project, I designed a 3D-printed brace that fits around the drill bit of a Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine. The brace is designed to hold a laser at the (0,0) position, or the center of the machine bed, aligned with the material. I used RhinoCAD to design the brace and then imported the design into the 3D printerâ€™s software to prepare it for printing using PLA material. After printing out my design in 3D printing, I had to troubleshoot how big or at what angle I have to design the brace in Rhino CAD. It took me a month to accomplish this, and now it is faster and easier to find the (0,0) origin point of the material, and can start cutting away in the material with the CNC machine.
